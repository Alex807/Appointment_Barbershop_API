# Appointment_Barbershop_API
Try to make my first API where I create a synchronized platform for appointments. 
Barber has a real-time list with all clients, data and service they want and client has list of free intervals to make appointment and feedback box. 
The barber has more clarity on his schedule and client avoids annoying waiting.
